- Identified strongly correlated socioeconomic indicators using Pearson correlation analysis for eight waste physical composition to be used as predictors[^1].

- Developed a Bayesian-optimized artificial neural network to concurrently optimize the model's learning rate and number of neurons to achieve minimum prediction error[^2].

- Forecasted the solid waste generation based on the ensemble learning approach which shows that the developed model reduces overfitting and forecast uncertainty compared to the default model[^3].
